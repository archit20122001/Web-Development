        Pyotr Velikiy is the last ship in the Kirov class battlecruiser, built
        for Soviet Navy. It currently serves as the flagship of the Northern Sea
        fleet of the Russian Navy. Originaly named Yuri Andrapov, the former
        general seceratory of the Communist Party, the ship's name was changed
        to Pyotr Velikiy after the fall of Soviet Union. The Russian designation
        for this type of ship is
        <a href="TARK.html"> Tyazheliy Atomnyi Raketnyi Kreiser </a>
        ,but the Western world considers them as Battlecruiser, because of their
        shir size and firepower.

        Construction of the ship was delayed by the national and economic
        problems before and after the fall of Soviet Union. It was not completed
        and commissioned until 1998, twelve years after work had started. by
        then, it had been renamed <b><i>Pyotr Velikiy</i></b
        >. Pyotr Velikiy carries a pennent number "099".<br />

        <br />
        <br />
        After completing its acceptence trials in 1996, the vessel was
        transferred to the Northern Fleet at Severomorsk and was designated as
        the Flagship of the Northern Fleet.<br />

        <br />
        In August 2000, Pyotr Velikiy was in the Barent Sea to oversee the
        largest naval training exercise in a decade, since the fall of Soviet
        Union. The ship was designated to be the target for the Oscar II class
        submarine K-141 Kursk, and was conducting evasive manouvers when
        communication with Kursk was lost. The submarine was found to have
        suffered catastrophic torpedo detonations, resulting in the loss of 118
        crew members. Pyotr Velikiy guarded the area where the submarine sank
        during the subsequent salvage operation in 2001. In March 2004, Russian
        Navy Chief Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov declared Pyotr Velikiy unfit for
        service due to problem with ship's engineering maintainance. on 19 April
        2004, the cruiser was docked in the floating drydock PD 50 for painting
        of the underside of the hull, repairs and examination of the steering
        system. The repairs were completed later that year, and it was carrying
        missions again by August.<br />
        From September 21 to October 22, 2004 she sailed on her first long
        voyage. Accompanying the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov,the
        destroyers Admiral Chabanenko and Admiral Ushakov, as well as several
        auxiliary ships, she went into the North-West Atlantic in what was the
        largest Russian naval exercise after the end of Cold War. During this
        time, Pyotr Velikiy demonstrated its various capabilities like, anti
        missile defence, anti air defence, anti ballistic missile defence and
        many more, its also used its P 700 Granits missile in the swarm
        technique where the missiles are launched in salvoes of 4 to 8 and they
        fly to the target with the lead missile designating different targets
        while the rest of the missiles track and destroyt their designated
        targets, if somehow, the lead missile gets destroyed, another missile
        from the group takes its position and starts target designation. On 8
        September 2008,it was announced that Pyotr Velikiy would sail to
        Caribbean Sea to participate in naval exercise with Venezuelan Navy,
        along with destroyer Admiral Chabanenko and other support ships. This
        action would represent the first major Russian show of force in the
        Caribbean since the end of the Cold War. On 22 September, Pyotr Velikiy
        and Admiral Chabanenko left their home port of Severomorsk.<br />
        On 22 October 2008 Pyotr Velikiy made a port visit to Aksaz Karagac,
        Turkey and on 6-9 November the cruiser and Admiral Chabanenko made a
        port visit to Toulon, France, before departing the Medieterranean on 10
        November, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar.<br />
        Pyotr Velikiy arrived in La Guaira, Venezuela on 25 November 2008
        coinciding the visit by Russian President Dimtri Medvedev. A combined
        exercise, VENRUS-200, with the Venezuelan Navy took place on 1-2
        December 2008. After finishing the exercises, Admiral Chabanenko made a
        short visit to Panama 5-10 December, then to Bluefields, Nicaragua from
        13 to 15 December and sailed into Havana, Cuba on 19 December.<br />
        Pyotr Velikiy continued alone to Cape Town, South Africa. On 11 January
        2009, the chief of Russian staff announced that Pyotr Velikiy and six
        other warships would participate in a joint naval exercise with Indian
        Navy later the same month. The Kirov-class cruiser paused for three days
        to visit Cape Town before continuing on to India.<br />

        On 31 January <i>Pyotr Velikiy</i> left the port of Mormugao in the
        Indian state of Goa. After a two-day visit that included a navl exercise
        with Indian guided missile destroyer INS Delhi the cruiser left for
        African waters where the vessels joined other warships from the Russian
        navy and conduct the INDRA-2009 exercise.<br />
        On 12 February, the ship captured ten pirates in three boats off the
        coast of Somalia.<br />
        On 10 March <i>Pyotr Velikiy</i> returned to its homeport of
        Severomorsk, ending a six-month deployment.<br />
        On 30 March 2010 Pyotr Velikiy left the Northern Fleet for a new
        six-month deployment. During its six-month tour of duty, the warship
        passed through Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean via Suez Canal. In
        the Indian Ocean the cruiser conducted maneuvers with other Russian
        warships of the Black Sea Fleet.<br />
        On 14 April, the missile cruiser visited the Mediterranean port of
        Tartus in Syria. In September 2008, Russia was reported to be in talks
        with Syria about turning Tartus into a permanent base for Russian
        warships in the Middle East.<br />

        In early May 2010, Pyotr Velikiy met with cruiser Moskva in the South
        China Sea. There they conducted joint exercises and held a traditional
        farewell ceremony on 5 May. The two vessels were due to arrive in
        Russia's Far Eastern port of Vladivostok to take part in VOSTOK-2010
        large scale strategic exercise.<br />
        On 29 September Pyotr Velikiy returned to its home base in the Northern
        Fleet after six months at sea. The flagship of the Northhern Fleet had
        covered 28,000 nautical miles(52,000 km; 32,000 mi) since the beginning
        of the mission on 30 March.<br />
        On 20 October, Pyotr Velikiy departed from the base of Severomorsk to
        pay a visit to the Bukhta Abrek bay in the Pacific region to meet her
        sister ship, Admiral Lazarev, which is anchored at the bay waiting to be
        scrapped after its decommisioning, thereafter it continued to the naval
        base of Vladivostok, where the ship conducted exercises and maneouvers
        with the Black Sea Fleet and them returned to port on 30 December.<br />
        Pyotr Velikiy, along with aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and the
        tanker Sergey Osipov, Kama and Dubna; the tugboat Atley, and the
        Repucha-class landing ship, Minsk(122) entered the English Channel to
        sail north. The British destroyer HMS Dragon monitered the Russian task
        force as it neared the United Kingdom. Once, the ship spotted each other
        they sailed briefly close by as a standard 'meet and greet'.<br />
        In May 2016 Pyotr Velikiy left Severomorsk to escort Admiral Kuznetsov
        to the Mediterrenean along with supply ships and two Udaloy-class
        destroyer, Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov. They were heading to
        the Eastern Mediterrenean to to support Syrian government forces
        battleing the rebel troops in Aleppo. Pyotr Velikiy passed through the
        English Channel along with the rest of the Russian Northern Fleet on 21
        October, shadowed by the British destroyer HMS Dragon.<br />
