The <b>Rockwell B-1 Lancer</b> is a variable-sweep wing, heavy bomber used by The United States Air Force. It is commanly called the "Bone" (from "B-One"). It is one
of three strategic bombers serving the U.S. Air Force fleet along with the B-2 Spirit and the B-52 Stratofortress as of 2022.<br>

The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of a B-52, and was meant to
ultimately replace both the bombers. After a long series of studies, Rockwell Internationals (now a part of Boing) won the design contest for what emerged as B-1A.
This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The combination of the high
cost of the aircraft, the introduction of AGM-86 cruise missile that flew the same basic speed and distance, and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly
reduced the need of B-1. This led to the program being cancelled in 1977, after the B-1A prototype had been built.<br>
The program was restarted in 1981, largely as an interim measure due to delays in the B-2 stealth bomber program. This led to the redesign as B-1B, which differed by
 having a lower top speed of Mach 1.25 at high altitude, speed to Mach 0.96. The electronics were also extremely improved, and the airframe was improved to allow
to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and the weapons load. Delieveries of the B-1B began in 1986 and formally entered with service with Strategic Air
Command (SAC) as a nuclear bomber that same year. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delievered.<br>
With the deestablishment of SAC and its reassignment to the Air Combat Command in 1992, the B-1B was converted for a conventional bombing role. It first during
combat during Operation Desert Fox in 1998 and again in NATO action in Kosovothe following year. The B-1B has supported the U.S. and NATO military forces in
Afganistan and Iraq. The Air Force has an inventory of 45 B-1Bs as of 2021. The Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider is to begin replacing the B-1Bs after 2025; all B-1s are
planned to be retired by 2036.<br>

 In 1955, the USAF issued requirements for a new bomber combining the payload and range of the Boing B-52 Stratofortress with the Mach 2 maximum speed of Convair
B-58 Hustler. In December 1957, the USAF selected North American Aviation's B-70 Valkyrie for this role, a six engine bomber the would cruise at Mach 3 at high altitude
. Soviet Union interceptor aircraft, the only effective anti-bomber weapon in the 1950s, were already unable to intercept the high flying Lockheed U-2; the Valkyrie would
fly at similar altitudes, but at much higher speeds, and was expected to fly right by the fighters.<br>
But in 1950s, however, anti-aircraft surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) could threaten high-altitude aircraft, as demonstrated by the 1960 drowning of Gary Powers' U-2.
The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) was aware of these developments and had began moving its bombers to low level penetration even before the U-2 incident. This
tactic greatly reduces the radar detection distances through the use of terrian masking; using the features of the terrian like the hills and the valleys, the line-of-sight
from the radar to the bomber can be broken, rendering the radar incapable of seeing it. Additionally, radars of the era were subject to "clutter" from stray returns from
the ground and other objects, which meant the minimum angle existed above the horizen were they could detect a target. Bombers flying at lower altitude could remain
under these angles simply by keeping their distances from the radar sites. These combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low flying aircraft. The
same effects also meant that low flying aircrafts were difficult to detect by high flying interceptors, since their radar systems could not readily pick out aircrafts against
the clutter of ground reflections lack of look down capabilities).<br>
The switch from high altitude to low altitude flight profiles severely affected the B 70, the design for which was tuned for high-altitude performance. Higher aerodynamic
drag at loe level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed whuile dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than
B-52, but less range. Because of this, and a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President
John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.<br>
Although never intended for the low-level role, the B-52's total bomb load to 60,000 pounds(27,000 kg), turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used
against ground troops along with strategic targets from the high altitudes. The much smaller bomb bay of the B-70 would have it much less useful in this role.<br>
Although effective, the B-52 was not ideal for the low-level role. This led to a number of aircraft designs known as penetrators, which were tuned specifically for long-
range low-altitude flight. The forst of these designs to see operation was the supersonic F-111 fighter-bomber, which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions.
A number of studies on a strategic-range counterpart followed.<br>
The first post B-70 strategic penetrator study was known as the Subsonic Low-Altitude Bomber (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This produced a design that looked
more like airliner than a bomber, with a large swept wing, T-tail, and large high-bypass engines. This was followed by the similar Extended Range Strike Aircraft (ERSA),
which added a variable-sweep wing, then en vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a 10,000-pound (4,500 kg) payload and a range
of 10,070 miles (16,210 km) including 2,900 miles (4,700 km) flown at low altitudes. In August 1963, the similar Low-Altitude Manned Penetrator design was completed,
 which called for an aircraft with a 20,000- pond (9,100 kg) bomb load and somewhat shorter range of 8,230 miles (13,240 km).<br>
These all culminated in 1963 Advanced Manned Precision Strike System (AMPSS), which led to industry studies at Boing, General Dynamics, and North American. In mid-
1964, the USAF had revised its requirements and retitled the project as Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft (AMSA), which differed from AMPSS primarily in that it also
demanded a high-speed high-altitude capability, similar to that of the existing Mach 2- class F-111. Given the lenghty series of design studies, Rockwell engineers joked
that the new name actually stood for "America's Most Studied Aircraft".<br>
 Program studies continued; IBM and Autonetics were awarded AMSA advanced avionics study contracts in 1968. McNamara remained opposed to the program in favor
of upgrading the existing B-52 fleet and adding 300 FB-111s for shorter range roles then being filled by the B-58. He again vetoed funding for AMSA aircraft development
in 1968.<br>
President Richard Nixon reestablished the AMSA program after taking office, keeping with his administration's flexible response strategy that required a broad range of
options short of general nuclear war. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked
the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In Aoril 1969, the program officially become the B-1A. This was the first entry in the
new bomber designation series, created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.<br>

The B1 has a blended wing body configuration with variable sweep wing, four turbofan engines, triangular ride-controlled fins and cruciform tail. The wings can sweep
from 15 degrees to 57.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). Forward swept wing settings are used for take-offs, landings and high altitude economical cruise. Aft-swept
wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight. The B-1's variable sweep wings and thrust to weight ratio provide it with improved takeoff performence,
allowing it to use shorter runways than previous bombers. The length of the aircraft presented it with a flexing problem due to their air turbulence at low altitude
