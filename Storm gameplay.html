like Sukhoi SU-75 Chrezmate and Mikoyan Mig-41. Its displacement will be approximately 1,00,000 tons, roughly the same as the Gerald R. Ford class, will be nuclear
powered and would reqire a crew of around 3000 men and 200 officers, it will able to carry 90 to 100 aircrafts and would be able to operate in the open seas for about
5 months. The carrier will provide Russia its first ever capability to perform operations beyond Barent Seas and Black Seas. Four carriers are planned to be completed by
2030 and the total cost of the programme is estimated to be 240.35 billion rubles. Here is a video of RF Shtorm from the game, Modern Warships: Sea Battle Online,
